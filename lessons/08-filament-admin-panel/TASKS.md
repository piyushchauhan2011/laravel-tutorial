# Tasks: Filament Admin Panel

## Implementation Steps

1. Install Filament and create admin panel.
2. Scaffold resources/forms/tables for key models.
3. Restrict visibility/actions using policies and roles.
4. Add widgets for queue backlog, scheduled tasks, or business KPIs.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/08-filament-admin-panel/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README

## Suggested Hands-On Exercises

1. Add role-aware table actions so editors can only see edit on own records.
2. Add another widget for posts created in the last 7 days.
3. Add a custom bulk action to publish selected posts.
4. Add E2E coverage for admin login and post creation flow.
