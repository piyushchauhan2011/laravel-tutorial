# Laravel CLI Foundations

## Objectives

- Understand Laravel folder structure and runtime lifecycle.
- Use Artisan for scaffolding, inspection, and maintenance commands.
- Configure environment variables and config caching safely.

## Recommended Order

- Start here before all other lessons.

## Lesson Sequence

1. Run artisan about, route:list, and config:show app to inspect runtime state.
2. Scaffold a sample model, migration, factory, seeder, and controller using Artisan.
3. Practice env/config caching commands and verify behavior before/after cache clear.
4. Add a simple /health route returning JSON with app name, env, and timestamp.

## Standards

- Use Pest for unit and feature tests by default.
- Keep lesson code documented with concise rationale comments where needed.
- Record evidence of completion in CHECKLIST.md before moving on.
