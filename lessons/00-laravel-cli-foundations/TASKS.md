# Tasks: Laravel CLI Foundations

## Implementation Steps

1. Run artisan about, route:list, and config:show app to inspect runtime state.
2. Scaffold a sample model, migration, factory, seeder, and controller using Artisan.
3. Practice env/config caching commands and verify behavior before/after cache clear.
4. Add a simple /health route returning JSON with app name, env, and timestamp.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/00-laravel-cli-foundations/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README
