# Tasks: Background Jobs, Queues, Workers

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement at least one queued job (report/email/export).
2. Configure queue connection and run worker with sensible flags.
3. Handle failed jobs and implement retry strategy.
4. Add queue health command and tests around dispatch behavior.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/04-background-jobs-queues-workers/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README
