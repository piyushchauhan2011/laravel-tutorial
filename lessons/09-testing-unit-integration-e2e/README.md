# Testing: Unit, Integration, E2E

## Objectives

- Build a practical Laravel testing strategy.
- Use Pest and PHPUnit together effectively.
- Validate user flows via Playwright.

## Recommended Order

- Run in parallel while doing other lessons, then consolidate here.

## Lesson Sequence

1. Standardize Pest setup across apps.
2. Add unit tests for services/policies/value objects.
3. Add integration tests for API, DB, queue interactions.
4. Configure Playwright for auth + CRUD + admin restrictions flows.

## Standards

- Use Pest for unit and feature tests by default.
- Keep lesson code documented with concise rationale comments where needed.
- Record evidence of completion in CHECKLIST.md before moving on.
