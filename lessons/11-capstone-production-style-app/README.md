# Capstone Production-style App

## Objectives

- Integrate CRUD, auth, API, queues, scheduler, analytics, and admin into one product.
- Demonstrate code quality with comprehensive tests.
- Rehearse production deployment flow end to end.

## Recommended Order

- Final lesson after completing 00-10.

## Lesson Sequence

1. Define capstone scope and domain model.
2. Implement core feature set across web, API, and admin surfaces.
3. Add async jobs, scheduled tasks, and CTE-backed analytics.
4. Pass unit, integration, and E2E tests; execute deployment rehearsal.

## Standards

- Use Pest for unit and feature tests by default.
- Keep lesson code documented with concise rationale comments where needed.
- Record evidence of completion in CHECKLIST.md before moving on.
- Keep API routes under /api/v1/* and use the shared response envelope contract.
