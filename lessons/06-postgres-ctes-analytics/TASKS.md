# Tasks: Postgres CTEs and Analytics

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement non-recursive CTE analytics query for aggregates.
2. Add one recursive CTE example (hierarchy or dependency graph).
3. Build API endpoint with params: from, to, group_by.
4. Add indexes and compare query plans with EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/06-postgres-ctes-analytics/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README
