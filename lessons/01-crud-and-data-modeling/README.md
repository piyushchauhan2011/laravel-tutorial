# CRUD and Data Modeling

## Objectives

- Design normalized relational schema with migrations.
- Implement Eloquent relationships, factories, and seeders.
- Build end-to-end CRUD with validation and authorization stubs.

## Recommended Order

- Complete after lesson 00.

## Lesson Sequence

1. Model projects, tasks, and labels including pivot table relationships.
2. Build CRUD pages for projects and tasks with form requests.
3. Add seeders/factories to generate realistic linked data.
4. Add feature tests for create, edit, delete, and validation failures.

## Standards

- Use Pest for unit and feature tests by default.
- Keep lesson code documented with concise rationale comments where needed.
- Record evidence of completion in CHECKLIST.md before moving on.
