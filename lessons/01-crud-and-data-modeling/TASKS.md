# Tasks: CRUD and Data Modeling

## Implementation Steps

1. Model projects, tasks, and labels including pivot table relationships.
2. Build CRUD pages for projects and tasks with form requests.
3. Add seeders/factories to generate realistic linked data.
4. Add feature tests for create, edit, delete, and validation failures.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/01-crud-and-data-modeling/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README
