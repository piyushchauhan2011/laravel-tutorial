## Implementation Steps

1. Build listing and detail pages with server-driven pagination.
2. Add composables for query params and persisted filter state.
3. Implement optimistic updates where appropriate.
4. Add E2E coverage for core UI journeys.

## Deliverables

- Working Laravel code in lessons/07-vue-inertia-advanced-ui/app
- Tests for implemented behavior (unit/integration and E2E where relevant)
- Notes on design decisions and tradeoffs in the lesson README

## Suggested Hands-On Exercises

1. Add a debounced search box that auto-applies filters after 400ms.
2. Add bulk actions (feature/unfeature) to selected products.
3. Add client-side remembered table column visibility.
4. Add Playwright coverage for login -> products -> filter -> detail flow.
